## Overview

This document outlines the major bugs discovered and resolved in the  
Lovable Skill Challenge – Confirmation Email Function for the Lovable App.

## Critical Fixes Implemented

### 1. Function Crashed with `Unexpected end of JSON input`

**File**: `functions/send-confirmation/index.ts`  
**Severity**: Critical  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed

#### Problem

On form submission, the Supabase Edge Function crashed and returned:

```json
{ "error": "Unexpected end of JSON input" }
```

This prevented confirmation emails from being sent successfully.

#### Root Cause

The function was originally attempting to parse the body using `await req.json()` (or equivalent logic), which throws an error when the request body is empty or improperly structured. This caused the handler to fail before validation or logging.

#### Fix

Replaced the unsafe JSON parsing with a safer pattern:

```ts
const textBody = await req.text();
const body: ConfirmationEmailRequest = JSON.parse(textBody);
```

This allowed us to log the raw request and handle invalid input with a graceful fallback.

#### Impact

- ✅ Function no longer crashes on malformed input
- ✅ Improved visibility into request payloads
- ✅ Enables clearer debugging in local or deployed environments

---

### 2. Invalid or Incomplete Input Caused Silent Failures

**File**: `functions/send-confirmation/index.ts`  
**Severity**: High  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed

#### Problem

When users submitted the form with missing fields (`name`, `email`, or `industry`), the function silently failed or misbehaved, depending on downstream logic.

#### Root Cause

There was no input validation after parsing the JSON payload, which led to invalid data being passed into the OpenAI and Resend APIs.

#### Fix

Explicitly validated the required fields:

```ts
if (!name || !email || !industry) {
  throw new Error("Missing required fields: name, email, or industry");
}
```

#### Impact

- ✅ Prevents invalid requests from reaching third-party APIs
- ✅ Produces useful developer error logs
- ✅ Improves function reliability and security

---

### 3. Redundant Invocation of Content Generator

**File**: `functions/send-confirmation/index.ts`  
**Severity**: Medium  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed

#### Problem

The function called `generatePersonalizedContent()` more than once per request under some conditions, doubling the load on OpenAI and risking inconsistent outputs.

#### Root Cause

Unnecessary reassignment and lack of caching of the content result.

#### Fix

Removed the second call and assigned the generated content once:

```ts
const personalizedContent = await generatePersonalizedContent(name, industry);
```

#### Impact

- ✅ Reduced OpenAI API token usage
- ✅ Faster execution time
- ✅ Consistent personalized email output

---

### 4. OpenAI Model Reference Standardized

**File**: `functions/send-confirmation/index.ts`  
**Severity**: Low  
**Status**: ✅ Confirmed & Clarified

#### Problem

The code relied on a hardcoded model name (`"gpt-3.5-turbo"`) without fallback or visibility into where it might break if environment settings changed.

#### Root Cause

Static model configuration combined with no check or error handling for invalid model or key behavior.

#### Fix

Confirmed and retained the correct `"gpt-3.5-turbo"` model and clarified its presence in request JSON. Also ensured fallback content is returned if OpenAI call fails.

#### Impact

- ✅ Prevents silent OpenAI errors
- ✅ Maintains compatibility with API expectations
- ✅ Keeps fallback strategy for reliability

---

### 5. Success State Triggered Even on Email Failure

**File**: `components/LeadCaptureForm.tsx`  
**Severity**: Medium  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed

#### Problem

Even when the confirmation email failed to send (e.g. due to 500 errors), the UI showed a success message and cleared the form.

#### Root Cause

The `setSubmitted(true)` and state reset were being called unconditionally after `supabase.functions.invoke(...)`, regardless of whether an error occurred.

#### Fix

Moved state update logic inside the success condition:

```ts
if (!emailError) {
  setLeads([...leads, lead]);
  setSubmitted(true);
  setFormData({ name: "", email: "", industry: "" });
}
```

#### Impact

- ✅ Avoids misleading user feedback
- ✅ Only shows success message on actual success
- ✅ Improves frontend reliability
